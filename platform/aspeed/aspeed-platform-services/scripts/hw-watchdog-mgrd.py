"""
Hardware watchdog manager daemon for Aspeed platforms.

The Linux watchdog framework allows only a single open of /dev/watchdog0 at a
time.  This daemon is the sole owner of the device: it opens it, pets it
periodically while armed, and exposes an IPC interface over a Unix domain socket
so that the SONiC watchdogutil platform API (sonic_platform/watchdog.py) can
arm, disarm and query the watchdog without contending for the device file.  The
socket lives in a dedicated directory (SOCKET_DIR) so that directory can be
bind-mounted into the pmon container (see docker_image_ctl.j2), letting
watchdogutil run inside pmon as well as on the host.

Boot-time arming policy is driven by platform.json (the "watchdog" section).
On a fresh boot the "boot_arm" flag decides whether the daemon arms the
watchdog, which lets u-boot/ABR hand off a running hardware timer that the
daemon then adopts.  Runtime arm/disarm requests (via watchdogutil) are recorded
in a small JSON "intent" file on tmpfs (/run) so they survive a daemon
restart/crash within a boot session; because /run is wiped on reboot, boot_arm
is authoritative again on the next boot.

The "shutdown_protect" flag arms a second behaviour: during a system
shutdown/reboot the daemon keeps the watchdog armed (closing the device without
the magic 'V' character) so the SoC is reset if the reboot path hangs.  On a
normal daemon stop/restart it instead disarms via magic-close so a stopped
daemon never leaves an unpetted watchdog.
