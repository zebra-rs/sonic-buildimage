SONiC Platform API - Watchdog class for Aspeed BMC

This module provides the Watchdog class for the Aspeed AST2700 BMC platform.

The hardware watchdog device (/dev/watchdog0) can only be opened by a single
process at a time.  On this platform the hw-watchdog-mgrd daemon owns the
device and pets it periodically.  This class therefore does not access the
device directly; instead it talks to the daemon over a Unix domain socket so
that watchdogutil arm/disarm/status work while the daemon keeps the watchdog
alive.

        Read the hardware watchdog state directly from sysfs.

        Fallback for is_armed() when the daemon is unreachable so that status
        still reflects the hardware (e.g. the daemon crashed while the watchdog
        was armed and is now counting down to a reset).

        This fallback is meaningful because of how the aspeed_wdt driver
        behaves (drivers/watchdog/aspeed_wdt.c):
          * It advertises WDIOF_MAGICCLOSE and the kernel runs with nowayout=0,
            so a clean stop needs the magic 'V' close (which the daemon writes
            on SIGTERM) but an *unclean* close (a daemon crash) leaves the
            watchdog running and counting down.
          * Its max_hw_heartbeat_ms (~71 min) is far larger than the timeouts
            we use, so the watchdog core does not start its own keepalive
            worker; after a crash nothing re-pets the device and it really does
            reset the box.
        In that crash window /sys/class/watchdog/watchdog0/state still reads
        "active", so this is the only way is_armed() can report the truth
        instead of a dangerous False until systemd restarts the daemon (which
        then re-adopts the live watchdog).  Reading sysfs does not open
        /dev/watchdog0, so it never contends with the daemon.
