# Cold-boot initializer for reset-tolerant GPIOs.
#
# Reset tolerance (per-pin control register bit6) keeps the direction (bit1) and
# output data (bit0) bits from being cleared by a WDT_SOC/EXTRSTN reset, so an
# output can hold its level across a BMC reboot. It does not stop software from
# rewriting the pin after the reset, which is why these lines must not be
# gpio-hogged in the device tree: a hog is applied unconditionally when the
# gpiochip probes and would clobber the level that survived the reset.
#
# So apply the power-on default only when this boot was not a watchdog-caused
# reset; on a warm reset re-drive the level the pin came up with, which is a
# no-op on the pad but re-arms reset tolerance and re-muxes the pad to GPIO for
# the next reset.
#
# Boot cause comes from the watchdog bootstatus, which the aspeed_wdt driver
# derives from the SCU WDT reset log. Note that U-Boot clears the power-on and
# EXTRST flags before Linux runs, so a reset that is not attributable to a WDT
# is treated as a cold boot here.
#
# The per-pin control register is passed in rather than derived: libgpiod v2
# dropped gpiofind, and gpioinfo's output is not a stable parsing target. For
# AST2700 the address is <controller base> + 0x180 + <line offset> * 4, e.g.
# cpe_ctrl is GPIOE2, offset 34 on gpio1 (0x14c0b000), giving
# 0x14c0b000 + 0x180 + 34 * 4 = 0x14c0b208.

# libgpiod v2 addresses lines by name, so neither gpiofind (removed in v2) nor a

# (pinctrl gpio_request_enable) and arms reset tolerance (gpiolib requests
# PIN_CONFIG_PERSIST_STATE for a non-transitory line); gpioset then drives the
# level. The aspeed pinctrl implements no gpio_disable_free, so releasing the
# line does not undo the mux and the pin keeps driving.
#
# --toggle 0 is required: a v2 gpioset with no toggle period never exits, it
# holds the request open until it is killed. Without it this script blocks
# forever and cpe-ctrl-init.service is stuck in "activating", which wedges
